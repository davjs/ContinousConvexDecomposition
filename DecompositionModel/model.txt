High:
If the direction of a bullet intersects with a convex a hole should be created.
If the bullet ray intersects with multiple convexes a hole should be made in the convex that is closest,
    if the hole goes all the way through a hole should be created on the next closest convex aswel and so forth...
    
Depth of the hole should be calculated so that:
calculateDepth(bulletDensity: 1, bulletSpeed: 1, convexDensity: 1) -> 0.
calculateDepth(bulletDensity: 0.5, bulletSpeed: 1, convexDensity: 1) -> 0.
calculateDepth(bulletDensity: 1, bulletSpeed: 1, convexDensity: 0) -> infinity
calculateDepth(bulletDensity: 1, bulletSpeed: 1, convexDensity: 0.5) -> 0.5
for example: bulletDensity * bulletSpeed - convexDensity

Med:
This should split the convex into two convexes along the bullet direction.
The mass of the bullet should be removed from the convex.

Low:
All lines intersecting with the bullet template should be removed and instead
